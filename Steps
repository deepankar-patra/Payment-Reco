Identify Data Sources:
FO Payments: Contains payment transaction data in the fo_transaction_payments table.
Portal : Contains payment transaction data in the portal_transaction_payments table.

2. Define Reconciliation Rules:
We'll reconcile transactions based on the following criteria: transaction ID, payment amount, payment date, and reference ID.

3. Data Extraction:
-- Extract payment data from FO Payments
SELECT
    transaction_id,
    reference_id,
    payment_amount,
    payment_date
FROM
    fo_transaction_payments;

-- Extract payment data from Portal
SELECT
    transaction_id,
    reference_id,
    payment_amount,
    payment_date
FROM
    portal_transaction_payments;


4. Data Comparison:
-- Compare payment data between FO Payments and Portal using reconciliation rules
SELECT
    'FO Payments' AS statement_source,
    transaction_id,
    reference_id,
    payment_amount,
    payment_date
FROM
    fo_transaction_payments
WHERE
    (transaction_id, payment_amount, payment_date, reference_id) NOT IN (
        SELECT
            transaction_id,
            reference_id,
            payment_amount,
            payment_date
        FROM
            portal_transaction_payments
    )
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Portal' AS statement_source,
    transaction_id,
    reference_id,
    payment_amount,
    payment_date
FROM
    portal_transaction_payments
WHERE
    (transaction_id, payment_amount, payment_date, reference_id) NOT IN (
        SELECT
            transaction_id,
            reference_id,
            payment_amount,
            payment_date
        FROM
            fo_transaction_payments
    );
